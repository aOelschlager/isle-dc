# Allows traefik to work as the edge router for multiple projects.
#
# By default the rules will redirect to ${SERVICE}.${COMPOSE_PROJECT_NAME}.traefik.me
# if working on localhost and ${SERVICE}-${COMPOSE_PROJECT_NAME}-XX-XX-XX-XX.traefik.me
# if working remotely, where XX-XX-XX-XX is the dashed version of your IP address.
#
# For a traefik to be able to route traffic to a given container, that
# container needs to be on the `gateway` network, otherwise traefik will
# discover it via Docker but will not be able to redirect traffic to it.
